Sorry for bad english, I need more practice.
I've been going through much lately. I entered the university at my home town at the Faculty of Computer Science and wrote some exams. Turns out, I'm quite a smart student! I got all the A marks for all eight subjects we are learning. Stydying here isn't that hard, actually. I also started learning C++ and I like Python much more now. We barely touched working with memory, but I hope everything will be fine. Anyway, I'm on my holidays now and I've got some plans to do here and there.

Oh, by the way, Happy New Year everyone!

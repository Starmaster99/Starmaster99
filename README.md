Sorry for bad english, I need more practice.
Well, we all know that Ukraine has been going through much lately. I just can't express what atrocities our "big and friendly brother" is doing to my people. Thousands of them lost their jobs, homes, and even friends and relatives. Personally I am living in occupied territory, Zaporizhya oblast', and we are having hard time dealing with economic catastrophe here. Just trying to live normally and believing in bright and peaceful future. I got stable internet connection several days ago and I can come back to learning new stuff.

Stay safe. Ð¡Ð»Ð°Ð²Ð° Ð£ÐºÑ€Ð°Ñ—Ð½Ñ–! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦
